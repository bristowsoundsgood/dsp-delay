## Introduction
This is my first attempt at creating a fully-functional audio FX plugin: a delay/echo effect with added harmonic excitement capabilities. This involves learning the relevant mathematics behind non-linear processing. All of this is self-taught.

## Intentions
* Delay DSP algorithm.
* Saturation / Excitation / Distortion DSP algorithms.
* VST3 & AU plugin format support.
